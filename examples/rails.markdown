    fix stringify_keys destructive behavior for most FormTagHelper functions

2011-08-03
==========

  * fix stringify_keys destructive behavior for most FormTagHelper functions
    add four new tests to verify that the other three methods that called stringify_keys! are fixed. verified that
    the tests break in master without the code patch. Closes [#2355](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/2355)
  * Quote these dates to prevent intermittent test failure. Suppose local time is 00:50 GMT+1. Without the quoting,
    the YAML parser would parse this as 00:50 UTC, into the local time of 01:50 GMT+1. Then, it would get written
    into the database in local time as 01:50. When it came back out the UTC date from the database and the UTC date
    of two weeks ago would be compared. The former would be 23:50, and the latter would be 00:50, so the two dates
    would differ, causing the assertion to fail. Quoting it prevents the YAML parser from getting involved.
  * Fix a bit precompile and lazy compile comments
  * make assert_difference error message not suck
