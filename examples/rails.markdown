==========

  * Fix tzinfo require (it broke test_raises_when_an_invalid_timezone_is_defined_in_the_config in railties)
  * Fix wrap_parameters initializer template
  * Be more lazy about creating time zone objects. Decreases startup time by about 10%. ([#734](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/734))
  * Don't refer to ActionController::Base in the wrap_parameters initializer - use config object instead. Cuts about 15% off the load time. ([#734](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/734))
  * Bump arel dependency
  * Use new SelectManager[#](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/)source method
  * Use new SelectManager[#](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/)projections= method
  * use update.key instead of update.ast.key. make better use of select manager.
  * Use a SelectCore rather than a full SelectManager
  * Refactor building the update manager
  * Support for multi-table updates with limits, offsets and orders
  * Support updates with joins. Fixes [#522](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/522).
  * Added Array[#](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/)prepend as an alias for Array[#](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/)unshift and Array[#](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/)append as
    an alias for Array[#](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/)<< [DHH]
  * Merge pull request [#2539](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/2539) from arunagw/delegate_expl
    Delegate expl
  * Requiring delegate.
  * Removing unnecessary require, solve 'circular require considered harmful' warning.
  * Fix typo
  * rake assets:precompile executes in production environment as default if RAILS_ENV was not provided
  * Merge pull request [#2536](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/2536) from arunagw/unused_var
    Unused variable removed.
  * Update travis config on @joshk's instructions
  * Unused variable removed.
  * Document Object[#](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/)public_send
  * Add a test for delegating a method ending in '=' as this is a special case.
  * Ensure empty has_many :through association preloaded via joins is marked as loaded. Fixes [#2054](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/2054).
  * Merge pull request [#2534](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/2534) from arunagw/public_send_require
    Need to include public_send
  * Need to include public_send
  * Split up the definitions in Module[#](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/)delegate depending on :allow_nil, and don't use exceptions for flow control in the :allow_nil => true case.
  * Fix the line number in the backtrace when Module[#](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/)delegate raises
  * Fix private methods which are delegated to. This previously worked because Module[#](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/)delegate previously ignored method visibility.
  * Just do the method call directly in Module[#](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/)delegate, if we can (we cannot for method names ending in '='). Two reasons: 1) it's faster, see
    https://gist.github.com/1089783 and 2) more importantly, delegate should not allow you to accidentally call private or protected methods.
  * Backport Object[#](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/)public_send to 1.8 so that we can implement Module[#](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/)delegate such that non-public methods raise

    [#2355](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/2355)
  * Quote these dates to prevent intermittent test failure. Suppose local time is 00:50 GMT+1. Without the quoting, the YAML parser would parse this as 00:50 UTC, into the local time of 01:50 GMT+1.
    Then, it would get written into the database in local time as 01:50. When it came back out the UTC date from the database and the UTC date of two weeks ago would be compared. The former would be
    23:50, and the latter would be 00:50, so the two dates would differ, causing the assertion to fail. Quoting it prevents the YAML parser from getting involved.
  * Fix a bit precompile and lazy compile comments
