===================

  * v1.0.21
  * docs got messed up somehow
  * v1.0.20
  * doa bug, annoying.

1.0.19 / 2011-07-23
===================

  * v1.0.19
  * Close [#1175](https://github.com/isaacs/npm/issues/1175) Add --production flag

  * Add tildes for >=0.1.0, not 1.0.0
  * Only use tilde range descriptor when package >=1.0
    Problem: When using `install --save`, npm prefixed the installed
    package version with the tilde range descriptor. This makes sense
    for packages that follow semver and have reached 1.0.0. But for
    packages < 1.0.0 semver allows APIs to change freely, so those
    should be packaged with the exact version that was installed,
    as implemented by this patch.
  * --save to devDependencies when --dev is set
  * Clear caches on DELETE better.
  * Don't scrub the cache on publish. Unnecessary
  * filter out the _etag, and use couch 1.1 'update_after'

===================

  * v1.0.18
  * Print a warning when the search index builds for the first time
  * Make search ridiculously fast.
    Mad props to @JasonSmith, @janl, @mikeal, and @maxogden for chipping in
    with various CouchDB skillz and insights.
    This is really awesome.
  * Make searches a little faster
    1. Even if the data is stale, use it, and then fetch the update.
    2. Tell couch to do the same.
  * require.paths is gone
  * ./configure needs submodules

1.0.17 / 2011-07-16
===================

  * v1.0.17
    Bump version because 1.0.16 was a DOA release. Whoops.
  * fix make latest
  * Update minimatch

1.0.16 / 2011-07-16

  * Close [#1062](https://github.com/isaacs/npm/issues/1062) Add 'pack' command to create a tarball
  * make doc
  * Make the global/local more clear, and add example of dep sharing
  * Don't install deps that would be satisfied by family
    This makes it possible to 'fix' the dependencies of dependencies,
    by specifying a precise version that the dependency can depend
    upon.
  * Setting to undefined is almost always a problem
  * Add node -v and npm -v to error output
  * Add more 'don't do this' around setting global config
  * Better default usage output
