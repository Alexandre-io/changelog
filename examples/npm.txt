1.0.19 / 2011-07-23

  * Only use tilde range descriptor when package >=1.0
    Problem: When using `install --save`, npm prefixed the installed
    package version with the tilde range descriptor. This makes sense
    for packages that follow semver and have reached 1.0.0. But for
    packages < 1.0.0 semver allows APIs to change freely, so those
    should be packaged with the exact version that was installed,
    as implemented by this patch.
  * --save to devDependencies when --dev is set

  * Don't scrub the cache on publish. Unnecessary
  * filter out the _etag, and use couch 1.1 'update_after'

  * Make search ridiculously fast.
    Mad props to @JasonSmith, @janl, @mikeal, and @maxogden for chipping in
    with various CouchDB skillz and insights.
    This is really awesome.

    1. Even if the data is stale, use it, and then fetch the update.
    2. Tell couch to do the same.
  * require.paths is gone
  * ./configure needs submodules
